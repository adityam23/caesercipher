# Caeser Cipher Implementation
Caeser Cipher implementation


In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the hardest and most widely known encryption techniques. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
  "If he had anything confidential to say, he wrote it in cipher, that is, by so changing the order of the letters of the alphabet, that not a word could be made out. If anyone wishes to decipher these, and get at their meaning, he must substitute the fourth letter of the alphabet, namely D, for A, and so with the others."
  - Suetonis, Life of Caeser

Usage->

For encrypting a file you have to define the shift and send it with the cipher.py
python cipher.py filename shift cipher
Filename needs to be the file which you want to encrypt.
Shift defines how much of a shift you want it to be at.
Cipher/Decipher defines when you want to encrypt the data or not.
For decrypting:
python cipher.py filename shift decipher
